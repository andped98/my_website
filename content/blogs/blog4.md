title: About me
---
I come from a  curious spot in Northern Italy, called South Tyrol. Although I am an Italian citizen, my mother tongue is Ladin, an old Rhaeto-Romance language, credited as a linguistic minority in Italy. Having been born in the German-speaking part of the country, I was raised using four different languages, namely Ladin, German, Italian and English. This multilingual aspect of my life helped me develop an open-minded attitude, as well as experience the benefits of cultural diversity. Living in between the German and Italian cultures, the Ladin people share a common history with their own customs and traditions. In addition, during my exchange program at the University of Washington, I had the possibility to immerse myself in yet another culture, the American one.
