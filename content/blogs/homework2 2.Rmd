# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
weather_v2 <- weather[,1:13]
weather_v3 <- weather %>%
  select(c(1:13))
tidyweather <-   weather_v2 %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, #columns 3 to 5
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "delta")

```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x= date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )


```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

#Your code goes here...
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  ) + facet_wrap(~month) +
  theme_wsj()

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>%
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE))

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r calculate_CI_using_formula,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

#install.packages("sjstats")
library(sjstats)
formula_ci <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval == "2011-present",!is.na(delta)) %>%
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta),
            sd_delta = sd(delta),
            count=n(),
            se_delta = se(delta),
            rating_low = mean_delta - se_delta*qt(0.975, count-1),
            rating_high = mean_delta + se_delta*qt(0.975, count-1))

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r calculate_CI_using_bootstrap,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(infer)
# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
boot_ratings <- comparison %>%
  # Select after 2011 withoun NA values
  filter(interval == "2011-present",!is.na(delta)) %>%
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response =delta)%>%
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps =1000, type ="bootstrap")%>%
  # Find the mean of each sample
  calculate(stat ="mean")

percentali_ci <- boot_ratings %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

percentali_ci
formula_ci[,5:6]

```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

Using the data from the comparison tab, we have selected years 2011 to 2019 using 103 observations to calculate the average annual delta, the standard deviation of the average annual delta, and built a 95% confidence interval. The calculations show that the average annual delta between 2011 to 2019 is 0.966, meaning that the temperature increased by an annual average of 0.966 between 2011 to 2019. We are 95% confident that the average annual delta will be between 0.915 and 1.02.

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?
```{r population proportion of Snapchat & Instagram, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Remove NA from dataframe
gss_v3 <- gss %>% 
  filter(gss$instagrm!= "NA") 


#Coding answer to number: if yes for Instagram or snapchat - 1, otherwise 0
gss_v3 <- gss_v3 %>%   
  mutate(instagram_or_snap = ifelse(gss_v3$instagrm == "Yes", 1, ifelse(gss_v3$snapchat == "Yes", 1,0)))

total_user =  sum(gss_v3$instagram_or_snap)
gss_v3 %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_users = sum(instagram_or_snap), n_distinct=length(sex),proportion_within_sex = number_of_users / n_distinct, proportion_inside_users = number_of_users / total_user)

```


1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
```{r create snap_insta, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
gss_v2 <- gss %>% mutate(snap_insta = ifelse(gss$instagrm == "Yes"| gss$snapchat == "Yes", "Yes", ifelse(gss$instagrm == "No"| gss$snapchat == "No", "No", NA)))
```

1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
```{r snap_insta_proportion, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
snap_insta_proportion <- gss_v2 %>% summarise(number_of_users = count(snap_insta == "Yes"), number_respondents = count(!is.na(snap_insta)), proportion = number_of_users/number_respondents)
 
snap_insta_proportion   
  
```

1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram
```{r 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
gss_v2$snap_insta_code <-  if_else(gss_v2$snap_insta == "Yes", 1,0)
formula_ci_user <- gss_v2 %>% 
filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
summarise(mean_user = mean(snap_insta_code),
  sd_user = sd(snap_insta_code),
  count=n(),
  se_user = parameters::standard_error(snap_insta_code),
  rating_low = mean_user - se_user*qt(0.975, count-1),
  rating_high = mean_user + se_user*qt(0.975, count-1))

formula_ci_user
```


## Twitter, by education level
Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
```{r degree, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
twitter_user <- gss 
twitter_user$degree = factor(twitter_user$degree, labels=c('Bachelor', 'Graduate', 'High school', 'Junior college', 'Lt high school', NA))
```
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
```{r high education level, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
twitter_user <- twitter_user %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = ifelse(degree == 'Bachelor'|degree == 'Graduate', 'Yes', ifelse( degree == 'Lt high school'|degree == 'High school'|degree ==  'Junior college', 'No' , NA)))
```

1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
```{r proportion of bachelor graduate, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
#With NA in dataset
twitter_user %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes") %>% 
  summarise(Use_twitter_prop = sum(twitter == "Yes") / length(bachelor_graduate == "Yes"), Not_Use_twitter_proportion = sum(twitter == "No") / length(bachelor_graduate == "Yes"), na_answer_proportion = sum(twitter == "NA") / length(bachelor_graduate == "Yes"))
#Without NA in dataset
twitter_user %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes" & twitter!="NA") %>% 
  summarise(Use_twitter_prop = sum(twitter == "Yes") / length(bachelor_graduate == "Yes"), Not_Use_twitter_proportion = sum(twitter == "No") / length(bachelor_graduate == "Yes"))
```

1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
```{r CI for use and not use, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
#CI for use
formula_ci_use <- twitter_user %>% 
filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes" & twitter!="NA") %>% 
mutate(yes_code = ifelse(twitter == "Yes", 1,0)) %>% 
summarise(mean_yes = mean(yes_code),
  sd_yes = sd(yes_code),
  count=n(),
  se_yes = parameters::standard_error(yes_code),
  rating_low = mean_yes - se_yes*qt(0.975, count-1),
  rating_high = mean_yes + se_yes*qt(0.975, count-1))
formula_ci_use
#CI for not use
formula_ci_not_use <- twitter_user %>% 
filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes" & twitter!="NA") %>% 
mutate(no_code = ifelse(twitter == "No", 1,0)) %>% 
summarise(mean_no = mean(no_code),
  sd_no = sd(no_code),
  count=n(),
  se_no = parameters::standard_error(no_code),
  rating_low = mean_no - se_no*qt(0.975, count-1),
  rating_high = mean_no + se_no*qt(0.975, count-1))

formula_ci_not_use
```

1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

Yes. The 95% confidence internal for yes is [19.55%,27.07%], the second interval shows that proportion of user is between [100% - 80.45%, 100%- 72.93%] or [19.55% , 27.07%].They show almost the same interval.



## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.

```{r email, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
email_minutes <- gss %>% filter(emailhr !='NA') %>% mutate(email= as.numeric(emailhr)*60  + as.numeric(emailmin))
```


1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amount of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?

```{r distribution of email, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(email_minutes, aes(x=email))+
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666") +
  labs(title="Most people spend on email not more than 120 minutes weekly", 
  y     = "Density",        #changing y-axis label to sentence case
    x     = "Minutes the respondents spend on email weekly") +
 geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(email)),
            color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=0.5)
            
#histogram
ggplot(email_minutes, aes(x=email)) + 
 geom_histogram(fill="#FF6666") +
  labs(title="Most people spend on email not more than 120 minutes weekly",
  y = "Number of people",
  x =  "Minutes the respondents spend on email weekly" ) +
 geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(email)),
            color="black", linetype="dashed", size=0.5)

getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

print(c('mean' = mean(email_minutes$email), 
 'median' = median(email_minutes$email),
  'mode' = getmode(email_minutes$email)))

```

As we can see in the density plot, there of tons of outliers in the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly and the distribution of email minutes is significantly positive skewed which makes the mean significantly larger than median. Thus, in this case, clearly median is less affected by these outliers and can measure the the typical amount of time Americans spend on email weekly.

1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.

```{r 95% bootstrap CI for email_minutes, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
email_mean <- email_minutes %>%
  
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response =email)%>%
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps =1000, type ="bootstrap")%>%
  # Find the mean of each sample 
  calculate(stat ="mean")

email_ci <- email_mean %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

print(email_ci)
```

As we can see, the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly is [6 hr and 23.3 minutes, 7 hr and 28.6 minutes]. We can see that the mean number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly (6 hr and 56.8 minutes) falls in the confidence interval.

1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

The 99% confidence interval shall be wider than the 95% confidence interval. Because Increasing the confidence to 99% will increase the margin of error and result in a wider interval.

```{r 99% bootstrap CI for email_minutes, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

email_ci99 <- email_mean %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.99, type = "percentile")
print(email_ci99)
```



# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Import approval polls data

glimpse(approval_polllist)

approval_polllist<-approval_polllist %>%

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.


You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.
```{r Compare Confidence Intervals, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
CI_week15<-approval_polllist %>%
  filter(year=="2020") %>%
  filter(enddate_week=="15") %>%
  summarise(mean_net_approve = mean(net_approve),
  sd_net_approve = sd(net_approve),
  count=n(),
  se_net_approve = parameters::standard_error(net_approve),
  net_approve_low = mean_net_approve - se_net_approve*qt(0.95, count-1),
  net_approve_high = mean_net_approve + se_net_approve*qt(0.95, count-1))
CI_week34<-approval_polllist %>%
  filter(year=="2020") %>%
  filter(enddate_week=="34") %>%
  summarise(mean_net_approve = mean(net_approve),
  sd_net_approve = sd(net_approve),
  count=n(),
  se_net_approve = parameters::standard_error(net_approve),
  net_approve_low = mean_net_approve - se_net_approve*qt(0.95, count-1),
  net_approve_high = mean_net_approve + se_net_approve*qt(0.95, count-1))
CI_week15
CI_week34
```

In the Week 34(17-23 August 2020), both the lower bound and higher bound of 95% Confidence Interval of the net approval of Trump declined from Week 15 (6-12 April 2020). This suggested that the approval rate of Trump declined over the 4 months. Also, it is noticeable that the width of the Confidence Interval increased over the period, which suggested that the estimated net approval rates was more difficult to estimate. This is consistent with the increase in standard deviation, which also demonstrated that the net approval rate in the sample is more divided. So generally speaking, as the election date coming closer, the approval rates from different pollsters became more different,and it is harder to estimate the result.

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries
```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

```{r}
# Tidying up data sets. Before, column names were values of a variable rather than the variablte itself.
life_expectancy_v2 <-
  life_expectancy %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(-country),
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "life_expectancy")

hiv_v2 <-
  hiv %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(-country),
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "hiv_prevelance")
```

```{r}
#Assigning isoc3 codes t0 countries to be able to match data frames more efficiently

# First, get a string of all country names
countries_1 <- life_expectancy_v2 %>% 
  select(country) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pull()

countries_2 <- hiv_v2 %>% 
  select(country) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pull()

# Use countrycode package to convert names to iso3c 
library(countrycode)
countrycodes_1 <- countries_1 %>% 
  countrycode(
    origin = "country.name",
    destination = "iso3c")

library(countrycode)
countrycodes_2 <- countries_2 %>% 
  countrycode(
    origin = "country.name",
    destination = "iso3c")

# add iso3c code on dataframes, using a left join
hiv_v3 <- left_join(hiv_v2, countries, by = "country")

life_expectancy_v3 <- left_join(life_expectancy_v2, countries, by = "country")

#Changing column "year" from character to numeric
life_expectancy_v3$year <- as.numeric(as.character(life_expectancy_v3$year))
hiv_v3$year <- as.numeric(as.character(hiv_v3$year))
  
#Aligning column name to other data sets
worldbank_data_v2 <- worldbank_data %>% 
  rename(year = "date")

#Prepare data sets to integrate
hiv_v4 <- hiv_v3 %>% 
  select(iso3c, year, hiv_prevelance)

life_expectancy_v4 <- life_expectancy_v3 %>% 
  select(iso3c, year, life_expectancy) 

#Integrating life_expectancy and hiv data into worldbank dataset
joined_data <- 
  merge(x = worldbank_data_v2, y = hiv_v4,
          by = c("iso3c", "year"))

joined_data_all <-
  merge(x = joined_data, y = life_expectancy_v4,
          by = c("iso3c", "year"))

joined_data_all_v <- 
  left_join(joined_data_all, countries,
            by = c("iso3c", "iso2c", "country"))

joined_data_all_vF <- joined_data_all_v %>%  
  filter(!is.na(region)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(life_expectancy)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hiv_prevelance))
unique(joined_data_all_vF$region)
```

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful

```{r}
ggplot(joined_data_all_vF, aes(x = life_expectancy, y = hiv_prevelance))+
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~region,
             scale = "free") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6, margin=margin(15,0,0,0)),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6, margin = margin(0,15,0,0)),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", margin = margin(0,0,5,0)),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, margin = margin(0,0,20,0)),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=8, face="bold", margin=margin(20,0,0,0)),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=8, face="bold"))+
  labs(x = "Life Expectancy", 
       y = "HIV Prevelance", 
       title="Data suggests a negative relationship between life expectancy and HIV prevelance",
       subtitle = "Sub-Sahara Africa shows the most HIV cases per 100 people aged 15-49")
```

Answer: As we can see in the scatter plots above, there are significant differences in HIV prevelance between regions. Looking at the life expectancy for each of the regions, it becomes clear that there is a genuine negative relationship between life expectancy and HIV prevelance. Although there are some outliers in the data set (see Sub-Saharan Africa) which bias the output, this relationship becomes obvious. 

The reason for that might be that both life expectancy and HIV prevelance are dependent on the overall healthcare system in the respective region. The data suggest that Sub-Saharan Africa has both a high HIV prevelance and low life expectancy compared to the other regions. In line with our hypothesis, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa tend to have a less developed healthcare system which might cause these rates.


1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

```{r}
joined_data_all_vF_2 <- joined_data_all_v %>%  
  filter(!is.na(region)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))

ggplot(joined_data_all_vF_2, aes(x = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD, y = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~region, 
             scale = "free") +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6, margin=margin(15,0,0,0)),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6, margin = margin(0,15,0,0)),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", margin = margin(0,0,5,0)),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, margin = margin(0,0,20,0)),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=8, face="bold", margin=margin(20,0,0,0)),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=8, face="bold"))+
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita", 
       y = "Fertility Rate (total, births per woman)", 
       title="A higher GDP leads to a lower Fertility Rate",
       subtitle = "Richer countries seem to have a lower fertility rate than low-income countries")
```

Answer: The data suggests an overall negative relationship between GDP per Capita and fertility rate. Richer countries in terms of GDP tend to have a better developed healthcare system which might prevent high fertility rates. This is why poor countries, mainly in the regions Sub-Saharan Africa ans South Asia, tend to have low GDP and high fertility rates. 

1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.

```{r}
missing_values <- joined_data_all_v%>% 
  filter(is.na(hiv_prevelance)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(region))

missing_values_v2 <- missing_values %>% 
  group_by(region) %>%
  count(is.na(hiv_prevelance))

missing_values_v3 <- missing_values_v2 %>% 
  rename("count_missing_values" = n)

ggplot(missing_values_v3, aes(x = reorder(region, -count_missing_values), y = count_missing_values)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, ang = 60, size = 10, margin=margin(15,0,0,0)),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, margin = margin(0,15,0,0)),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold", margin = margin(0,0,30,0)),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=12, face="bold")) +
  labs(x = "none", 
       y = "No. of NA for HIV prevelance", 
       title = "Especialy for Sub-Saharan Africa, there are many missing data points for HIV prevelance")

```

Answer: The data basis developed countries such as the US seems to be better than for developing countries. This might be due to the lack of traceability and healthcare system standards.

1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.

Answer: In nearly all countries the mortality rate for under 5 has significantly improved between 1980 and 2016. However, there some huge differences in the developments. For example the mortality rate in Dominica got even worse than in 1980. Whereas there is no other case like that, overall economic growth and increasing healthcare spending suggest a decline in mortality rate. Dominica seems to be an outlier and one have to investigate the reasons for such development. For example Saudi Arabia is a positive example. Between 1980 and 2016 there is a significant decline in mortality rates. Also by looking at different regions in the density plot, one case see the significant improvements. The negative numbers on the x-axis indicate decline in mortality rate which is positive. Generally, in Sub-Saharan African there is a positive trend. However, compared to other regions (e.g.Middle East and North Africa), the improvement was not that good. 

1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?
```{r}
joined_data_all_vF_4 <- joined_data_all_v %>%  
  filter(!is.na(region)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(SE.PRM.NENR)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))
ggplot(joined_data_all_vF_4, aes(x = SE.PRM.NENR, y = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~region, 
             scale = "free") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, margin=margin(15,0,0,0)),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8, margin = margin(0,15,0,0)),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold", margin = margin(0,0,5,0)),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, margin = margin(0,0,20,0)),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=10, face="bold", margin=margin(20,0,0,0)),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=10, face="bold"))+
  labs(x = "Primary School Enrollment (% net)", 
       y = "Fertility Rate (total, births per woman)", 
       title="Strong negative relationship between Primary School enrollment and Fertility Rate",
       subtitle = "If primary school enrollment is present, fertility rates seem to be lower")
```

Answer: The data suggests a strong negative correlation between primary school enrollment (% net) and fertility rate. This is perfectly shown in the Sub-Saharan Africa scatter plot. The date does not suggests differences among regions. However, we think that the factors do not necessarily impact each other but rather have another common factor which influences both variables.

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()


```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not

```{r}
# We use the covid_data dataset and select the data we need for this graph

data_g1 <- covid_data %>%
  filter(sex == c('Male', 'Female'),
         death_yn != "Unknown",

  summarise(number_of_death = count(death_yn %in% 'Yes'),
            all = count(death_yn %in% c('Yes', 'No')),
            death_rate = 100*number_of_death / all)

# We plot using ggplot2

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.

```{r}

Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r Bikes hired per month,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.width=15}
bike15_20 <- bike %>% filter(year>=2015) %>% mutate(month0 = month(day))

ggplot(bike15_20, aes(x=bikes_hired))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_grid(rows=vars(year),cols=vars(month))+
  labs(title = "Distribution of bikes hired per month",
       x= 'Bike Rentals', y = "") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(20000, 40000, 60000), 
                labels = c('20K', '40K', '60K'))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_bw()+
  NULL
```


Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

One sentence-answer

Bike Rentals in May and Jun in 2020 dropped significantly from previous years because of the lockdown caused by the covid-pandemic.

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

```{r monthly_change, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.width=12}
bike15_19 <- bike %>% filter(year>=2015&year<=2019) %>% mutate(month0 = month(day))
#Calculate the monthly average between 2015-2019 using median 
expected_monthly_rentals <- bike15_19 %>% group_by(month0) %>% summarise(median_ex=median(bikes_hired))
#Calculate the acutual monthly average between 2015-2020 using median 
bike_month <- bike15_20 %>% group_by(year,month0) %>% summarise(median_ac=median(bikes_hired)) 
#left_join the dataframe
bike_month_excess <- left_join(bike_month,expected_monthly_rentals,by='month0')
bike_month_excess <- bike_month_excess %>% mutate (maxline=ifelse(median_ex>median_ac,median_ex,median_ac),
                                                   minline=ifelse(median_ex<median_ac,median_ex,median_ac))

# replicate the plot with two ribbons using different colors
ggplot(bike_month_excess,aes(x=month0))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=minline,ymax=median_ex),fill='lightpink')+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=median_ex,ymax=maxline),fill='lightgreen')+

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
